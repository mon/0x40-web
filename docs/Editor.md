# Beatmap Editor

Creating new songs is the heart of the Hues experience. The inbuilt editor makes it a breeze! To get to it, either hit your `e` key or click the settings cog, then hit `EDITOR`.

Before you begin, you'll actually need a song to edit! You might be able to find good loops online, or you can make your own from a song you enjoy. The best way to make your own is using Audacity, detailed in the [MP3 guide](MP3 Export.md).

1. Load your loop using the `LOAD LOOP` button. If everything went well, it should start playing.
2. In the `Title` box, enter the Artist - Song Name combination, e.g. "Madeon - Finale" (without quotes)
3. Enter a source into the `Source` box if you have it - if you share your loop, it's nice to give other people a link to a high quality original.

Now your loop is playing! Adjust time with the `HALVE` and `DOUBLE` buttons until the loop's beats match up with your beatmap. If you're happy with it, you can click the lock icon next to the beat count, and entered beats will override previous beats instead of adding to the total.

From here, you can edit the rhythm. Check the Beat Glossary on the `INFO` tab to see what characters you can use.

A good way to start is lining up the bass or snare hits before moving on to another instrument, rather than trying to do everything at once. If you find yourself needing more space for notes, you can always use `DOUBLE`.

Once you've made your loop, you can optionally add a Buildup and repeat the process to edit its map.

When you're finished, **don't forget** to copy or save the XML to save your work! You can then put your song into a [respack](Respacks.md) and share it!

### Editing tips  
- Right click on the beatmap to seek to that position. Don't wait until the song repeats!
- Use the buttons at the bottom left to slow the song down and make tricky sections easier to map.
- Rewind to the start of the song or the start of the buildup with the arrows next to the `Buildup` and `Rhythm` labels.
- If you need more room to edit a part, resize it with the handle in between the sections.
- If your song isn't in 4/4 time, try changing the `New line at beat` setting so your bars line up.

One last advanced tip - if your buildup is crazy different from your rhythm and is proving hard to map, click the chain icon on the left to unlink the 2 sections. **Your song will no longer be compatible with the flash** but the buildup and rhythm can have separate map lengths. Let your creativity go nuts!
